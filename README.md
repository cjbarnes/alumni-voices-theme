# Wordpress Theme

This is the Wordpress theme for the University of York WP Engine install.

## Development

All development work is done on the staging site. Clone the repo and switch to the `dev` branch. Make changes, upload them via FTP to the staging site. After testing, merge the `dev` branch in to the `master` branch.

Only upload from `master` branch to the live site.
